# busmall-start

pretty horrific start, but it's okay. On this first day, our objective was to make a simulated market tool for focus group testing that allowed people to pick an object from a random selection of three and then display their results on which ones were seen the most and which ones were picked the most by them after the end of 25 clicks.
